# Trouble Shooting Commands

>To check if a particular port is open on your Mac, you can use the “lsof” command. For instance, to check whether port 8080 is open, you would type “lsof -i :8080” in the terminal. This will show you a list of all the processes using port 8080. You can also use the “nmap” command to scan for open ports on your Mac.
>>lsof -i :8080
>>> get the PID
> >>> kill -9 [PID]
